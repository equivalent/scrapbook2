notable changes

* EB with Linux 2 prefers `docker-compose.yml` against
  `Dockerrun.aws.json`
* Environment properties - EB will not automatically pass the
  enviroment variables. you need to map `.env` file with your
docker-compose.yml

## export / retrieve PostgreSQL dump from EBS RDS

the way how RDS backups works is that they create snapshot of the RDS
instance including data, therefore when you retrieving RDS backup you
are just rolling back state of snapshot. This is eficient enough as
backup
There is no way how to pull this snapshot from AWS. 

The only way how to acually do real `pg_dump` is to do fallowing

1. create a new micro EC2 instance and add it to *same security group as your production webservice* (...or create new security group so that this instance will have right to create connection to Postgresql 5432) # I'm not recommending SSH to one of your production EC2 instance
2. instal pg_dump on this instance 
3. `pg_dump dbname=my_db_name --username=my_db_username
   --host=somethingsomething.com --password > /tmp/dump.sql`
4. `scp` to your computer
